%h4 How to use this tool:

%h5 Getting started

%p Add keywords either individually or via the multiple keywords option. Once you are done, run the following:
%pre rake scraper:get_all
%p The rake task will run and in between each keyword it will pause for a random number of seconds. Please note that if you do this too much Google may temp-ban you!

- if Keyword.all.count == 0
  %p You don't have any keywords, so #{link_to 'make some now', new_keyword_path}!

%h5 Color coding of Allintitle Counts

%ul
  %li <span class='#{color_for_allintitle(1000)}'>#{color_for_allintitle(1000)}</span> results are counts that are low competition (1-1000 results) 
  %li <span class='#{color_for_allintitle(2000)}'>#{color_for_allintitle(2000)}</span> results are counts with moderate competition (1001-2000 results)
  %li <span class='#{color_for_allintitle(2001)}'>#{color_for_allintitle(2001)}</span> are those with high competition (2001+ results)

%h4 FAQ

%h5 What does "ready to scrape" mean?

%p This is whether 24 hours have elapsed since the last scrape. The system is designed to only allow a scrape every 24 hours to keep you from getting BS data (changes per hour don't matter) and also to keep from hitting Google super hard (why would you want to get IP banned?)

%h5 What is the "reset allintitle" option?

%p This goes through and deleted every title_results object from the DB associated with the keyword. <strong>It is highly destructive and permanently wipes the history from your DB, so avoid unless absolutely necessary!</strong>.
